### Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m currently working on: 
* studying seals from space for my PhD.

🌱 I’m currently learning: 
* how to automate and version control non-traditional data science datasets (eg GIS datasets).

💬 Ask me about: 
* seals, remote sensing, cold places, EDI, immersive technology.

⚡ Fun fact: 
* seals have a sense of rhythm and can vocalise in ultrasonic frequencies 🦭.

🌃 Collaborator / Partners:
* I'm a part of the British Antarctic Survey 🗻, the University of Cambridge's Scott Polar Research Institute 📖, the World Wildlife Fund 🐼, the Alan Turing Institute 🧠 and National Geographic 🌍. I collaborate with fun institutes through my PhD and the grassroots organisation Polar Impact. This includes: University of Oxford 🖋, Royal Museums Greenwich 🏛, Digital Catapult 💽 and the BBC 🎥.
