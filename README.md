### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**psg32/psg32** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: 
* studying seals from space for my PhD.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: 
* how to automate and version control non-traditional data science datasets (eg GIS datasets).
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about: 
* seals, remote sensing, cold places, EDI, immersive technology.
- âš¡ Fun fact: 
* seals have a sense of rhythm and can vocalise in ultrasonic frequencies ğŸ¦­.
